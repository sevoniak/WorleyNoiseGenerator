# WorleyNoiseGenerator
A simple Worley Noise Generator that I wrote as a challgent to myself to see if I could. Worley Noise is a cellular type of noise that can be used for the procedural generation of textures.

## Description
I wrote this in Visual Studio 2012 for the Windows platform.
It generates Worley Noise based on the user's parameters. There are currently 6 types of noise that can be viewed, and the resulting image can be saved to disk as a bitmap.

## Dependencies
The library "comctl32.lib" must be linked in order for this to compile.

## Releases
See the Releases section for a pre-built version for Windows
